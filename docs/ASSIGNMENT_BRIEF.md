## Brief

A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front-end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front-end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.

## Terminology

Visitor – a user who has not registered or logged in.
Customer – a user who has registered and logged in as a customer.
Venue Manager – a user who has registered and logged in as a Venue Manager.

## User Stories

All users:

- May view a list of Venues.
- May search for a specific Venue.
- May view a specific Venue page by id.
- May register as a customer with a stud.noroff.no email address and password.
- May register as a Venue Manager with a stud.noroff.no email address and password.
- May view a calendar with available dates for a Venue. Should dates be booked this must be indicated within the calendar.
  Customers:
- May login and log out once registered.
- May create a booking at a Venue.
- May view their upcoming bookings.
- May update their avatar/profile picture (a placeholder avatar/profile picture may be provided as a default until the customer updates it).

Venue Managers:

- May login and log out once registered.
- May create a Venue.
- May edit/update a Venue they manage.
- May delete a Venue they manage.
- May view upcoming bookings made at a Venue they manage.
- May update their avatar/profile picture (a placeholder avatar/profile picture may be provided as a default until the Venue Manager updates it).

## Process

1. Create a GitHub repository where you will commit and deploy your code.
2. Create a Kanban plan for your project using GitHub Projects or Trello. Note if you decide to use GitHub projects for your Gannt Chart that your project must include a Roadmap View.
3. Create a Style Guide using Figma. The style guide must include the logo, font pairings, color palette that includes primary and secondary colors as well as common components used throughout the web application.
4. Create a prototype in Figma for desktop and mobile screen sizes. The prototype does not need to be interactive and should be used to test out different layouts. You are allowed to make changes to your delivered project from the prototype.
5. Use your plan and design documents to complete the user stories, committing your code frequently. Make sure all your final work has been merged into the main or master branch.
6. Write a descriptive README.md that describes your project thoroughly, including how to setup and run the project locally.
7. Manually test each user story to ensure that it is completed.
8. Test the web application with online tools such as the HTML Markup Validation Tool, Lighthouse and WAVE.
9. Deploy your project using a static hosting platform such as GitHub Pages or Netlify.
10. Deliver the required links to your work

### Time Commitment

Full Time – 6 weeks | Part-Time – 14 weeks

### Submission

Please upload the required links to your work as online text in Moodle for your submissions. The required links are as follows:

- Link to your Kanban board
- Link to your Gannt chart
- Link to your Figma style guide
- Link to your Figma design
- Link to your GitHub repository
- Link to your deployed web application

## Submission Access

Please ensure that you test that each of your links are accessible prior to submission. Should a link not be accessible by the grader, no marks will be allocated. You can test if links are accessible by opening them in an Incognito tab.
